# Why

- making a frontend, so people can interact with a ready backend (deployed contract to testnet)
- making it minimally, so this POC doesn't involve learning much new tech

# Backlog

- make buttons visible ✅
- update constants ✅
- make 1 button work: convert integer to colorhex
  - show result in JS console (enough for PoC) ✅
  - show result on webpage
