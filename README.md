# Why

- making a frontend, so people can interact with a ready backend (deployed contract to testnet)
- making it minimally, so this POC doesn't involve learning much new tech

# How

- [Gotta figure out how I update this page, sourcing from separate files and flattining it into one, it would seem, then version controlling the main page, and THEN how I upload to IPFS.]
  - sourcing from separate files
